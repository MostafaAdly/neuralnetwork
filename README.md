Simple Neural Network that can do alot of stuff. One thing is the "Hello, World!" of Machine Learning (MNIST Classifier)

Features:
- MNIST Classifier
- Save/Load Network
- Object Oriented Programmed
- Made in Java = Open Source

Usage:
- **NOTE**: Running the network with low-end devices is not **RECOMMENDED**
- You have to download Java on your device (At least Java 8).
- You can just download the 2 files that exist in "Network/" directory and just run "start.bat"

*If the last one is not possible for you, You can open any terminal on your device, head to where you located the jar file and use the command "java -jar NeuralNetwork.jar" to run it from a terminal*

Final Note:
- The code was meant for learning purposes, you can edit the code however you want at your responsibility.
- Thanks for reading :)
